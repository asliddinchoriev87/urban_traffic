Reinforcement Learning in Urban Traffic Management

The City Brain uses a Reinforcement Learning-based system to optimize traffic light coordination and incident response.
- State Space: Real-time traffic density, signal status, GPS data, time of day, and environmental conditions
- Actions: Adjust traffic light durations, coordinate signal patterns across intersections, prioritize emergency vehicles
- Reward Function: Minimize vehicle wait time, reduce overall travel time, lower CO2 emissions, and improve emergency response
- Algorithm: Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

The implementation of RL via Alibabaâ€™s City Brain has shown measurable success in Hangzhou:
- Increased average traffic speed by 15%
 -Reduced emergency vehicle response time by up to 50%
- Significantly reduced congestion during peak hours
